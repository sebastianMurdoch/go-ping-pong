Simplest ping - pong app for Heroku

Its getting more and more common to have a resource /ping to which a pong is responded to test if your app is alive. Lets build this simple golang app for Heroku.

*First of all, in order to complete these steps and have your app running, you need to have a Heroku account. Don't worry its free. Also, I'll definetively recommend Heroku CLI for managing your projects.*

This project is meant to be a Hello World app in Heroku so the main code is very simple:

```go
func main() {
	port := os.Getenv("PORT")
	if port == "" {
		port = "8080"
	}

	app := http.NewApp()

	if err := app.Run(":"+port); err != nil {
		log.Printf("%s", "Error running server")
	}
}
```
Once you're done with the code you need to add a Procfile which tells Heroku where is your binary
```
web: bin/go-rest-api
```
You also need to manage your dependencies 
```
go mod init 
```
Finally link your github project to your Heroku account
```
heroku login

heroku create

git push heroku master
```
And voil√† ...You have your app running on Heroku servers 
```
heroku open
```
